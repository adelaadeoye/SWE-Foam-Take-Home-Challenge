# SWE-Foam-Take-Home-Challenge
Here at Culture, we run all kinds of experiments for our clients. These experiments run inside of reactors and can go for any amount of time. This makes it tough to monitor them around the clock for any problems. One of the common problems is that a reactor may start “foaming”. This is where foam starts to build up towards the top of the reactor and there is a risk of it spilling over. In these cases we may need to add an anti-foaming agent to preserve the run.
